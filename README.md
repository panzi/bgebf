bgebf
=====

Unpack, list and mount [Beyond Good and Evil](http://ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=9680)
.bf archives.

Basic usage:

	bgebf.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .bf archive
	bgebf.py unpack <archive>               - extract .bf archive
	bgebf.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

File Format
-----------

Extracted from the source of bfbs.c which you can get [here](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html).

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding seems to be ISO-8859-1.
A value of 0xFFFFFFFF for any field denoting an index is a "null pointer". E.g.
the root directory has a parent directory index of 0xFFFFFFFF. (It might actually
be a signed 32bit integer and the value is -1.)
